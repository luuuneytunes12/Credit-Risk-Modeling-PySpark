    "##### 1.3 Sorting Dataset\n",
    "For credit risk modeling, banks use past data loan data to predict future defaults / metrics. As such, we want our dataset to be sorted in **chronological order**, so that built models are trained on older data, and tested on newer data **(out-of-time split)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "There should not be random splitting of data **(out-of-sample split)**, e.g. `train-test-split` from `sklearn` since credit-risk modeling is a **time-series problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I will be sorting the dataset right from the start. \n",
